# Intune Guide: Securing Wi-Fi Passwords on Windows Devices

## Overview
This document outlines the configuration strategies available in Microsoft Intune to prevent users from viewing or retrieving Wi-Fi passwords (Pre-Shared Keys) on managed Windows 10/11 devices.

**Target Scenario:**
*   **Network Type:** WPA/WPA2/WPA3-Personal (PSK).
*   **Challenge:** Personal networks require the password to be cached on the device to function. Therefore, "Remember Credentials" cannot be disabled.
*   **Goal:** Prevent the user from viewing the cached password via the Windows UI or Command Line.

## Strategy 1: Deploy Wi-Fi Profile via Intune (Foundation)
**Why:** By pushing the profile via Intune, the user never needs to type the password manually. If they don't type it, they don't know it. Additionally, Intune-managed profiles often lock the "Properties" UI by default and password cannot be vieuwed. 

**Configuration Steps:**
1.  Navigate to **Devices** > **Windows** > **Configuration profiles**.
2.  Click **Create** > **New Policy**.
3.  Platform: **Windows 10 and later**.
4.  Profile type: **Templates** > **Wi-Fi**.
5.  Policy Name: **WIN - DC - Wi-Fi Profile - Office Wi-Fi Network**.
6.  Wi-Fi Type: **Basic**.
7.  Wi-Fi Name (SSID): **Enter the exact SSID of your network**.
8.  Connection Name: **Enter a user-friendly name (e.g., "Corporate Wi-Fi")**.
9.  Connect automatically: **Yes.**
10. Wireless Security Type: **WPA/WPA2-Personal.**
11. Pre-shared key (PSK): **Enter the Wi-Fi password here**.
12. Assignment: **Device Group** (Ensures the device connect to the Wi-Fi network before a user logs in.)

## Strategy 2: Hide the Wi-Fi Settings Page (Recommended)
**Why:** This removes the "Wi-Fi" and "Network Status" pages from the Windows Settings app. If the user cannot access the page, they cannot click the "View Wi-Fi Security Key" or "Show" button.

**Configuration Steps (Settings Catalog):**
1.  Navigate to **Devices** > **Windows** > **Configuration profiles**.
2.  Click **Create** > **New Policy**.
3.  Platform: **Windows 10 and later**.
4.  Profile type: **Settings catalog**.
5.  Name the profile (e.g.,): **"WIN - SC - Device Security - Hide Wi-Fi Network Settings"**
6.  Click **Add settings** and search for **"Page Visibility"**.
7.  Select: **Settings** > **Page Visibility List** or **Page Visibility List (User)**.
8.  Enable the setting. In the **Settings Page Visibility** text box, enter the following string exactly: **hide:network-wifi;network-status**
9. Assignment: **User Group** Block regular users from seeing the Network Settings, but you (the IT Admin) If the policy is assign to a Device Group, the Wi-Fi settings page will be hidden for everyone who logs into that computer, including (the IT Admin).

## Strategy 3: OMA-URI Policy (CSP Method) (Deprecated - Not Working- not compatible with the new Windows 11 24H2 network UI (which now includes the QR code feature))
**Why:** This is the specific Windows Configuration Service Provider (CSP) setting designed to disable the password view button.
*Note: This setting can be inconsistent on newer Windows builds compared to Strategy 2.*

**Configuration Steps:**
1.  Navigate to **Devices** > **Windows** > **Configuration profiles**.
2.  Click **Create** > **New Policy**.
3.  **Platform:** Windows 10 and later.
4.  **Profile type:** Templates > **Custom**.
5.  Click **Add** to create a row:
    *   **Name:** WIN - DC - (OMA-URI) - DEV - Disable Show Wi-Fi Password
    *   **OMA-URI:** `./Device/Vendor/MSFT/Policy/Config/Connectivity/DoNotViewWiFiPassword`
    *   **Data type:** Integer
    *   **Value:** `1`

## Summary of Options

| Option | Method | Description | Pros | Cons |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1** | **Deploy Wi-Fi Profile** | Push the SSID and Password via Intune. | User never types the password; seamless connection. | Does not strictly block "viewing" if the user is savvy. |
| **2** | **Hide Wi-Fi Network Settings Page** | Use `hide:network-wifi` in Settings Catalog. | Native, reliable, blocks the UI button effectively. | Hides other Wi-Fi settings (like MAC randomization). |
| **3** | **OMA-URI CSP** | Use `DoNotViewWiFiPassword` CSP. | The "official" policy for this specific button. | Can be unreliable on specific Windows builds (error -2016281112). |
